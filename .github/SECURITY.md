## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of ContainerGuard seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly**
2. **Email us directly at [temp@gmail.com](mailto:temp@gmail.com)** with details about the vulnerability
3. Include the following information in your report:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Full path to the vulnerable file
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any suggested fixes or mitigations

We aim to acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports within 48 hours, and will provide a more detailed response within 7 days indicating the next steps in handling your report.

## Security Update Process

When a security vulnerability is reported and confirmed, we will:

1. Acknowledge the vulnerability and assign it a tracking identifier
2. Develop a fix and patch for the issue
3. Release a security update as soon as possible
4. Disclose the vulnerability publicly after the fix is released

## Security Best Practices

When using ContainerGuard, we recommend following these security best practices:

1. **Keep ContainerGuard Updated**: Always use the latest version of ContainerGuard, which will include the latest security patches.
2. **Use Strong Authentication**: Protect your Docker registry credentials and API keys with strong authentication.
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run ContainerGuard with the minimum permissions necessary to perform its functions.
4. **Review Scan Results**: Regularly review scan results and address identified vulnerabilities promptly.
5. **Configure Properly**: Follow our hardening and configuration guides to secure your ContainerGuard installation.

## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure

We follow the practice of coordinated vulnerability disclosure. This means that we work with the reporter of a vulnerability to ensure that a fix is available before the vulnerability is disclosed publicly.
